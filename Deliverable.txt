Deliverable 2:
Write a description of what you thought about when you were designing the code. 
What did *you* think was important to do to make it easy to test the program. 
What are some of the challenges that you faced when testing this assignment.


While I was writing my code I thought that the tester would want to be able to test the api for an exisitng user but invalid repo separately.
I created a sceondary function for the tester to be able to test this easily. 
I also included a lot of print statements so the tester can easily see the reponse status of the request.
Lastly, I at frist wanted to just print the output as the code ran, but I realized I must return the output so that they tester can use selfAssert.
A challenge I faced was the limit of 60 requests per hour.
